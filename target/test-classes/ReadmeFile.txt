Value of gated SPECT MPI for Ischemia-Guided PCI of non-culprit vessel in STEMI patients
			with multi vessel disease after primary PCI 
Sponsor detail  : International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Vienna 
Study Category : Cardiovascular 
CTRI    : CTRI/2018/02/017474 
Data Manager  : Dr Niveditha Devasenapathy 
Study design  : International, non – inferior, open labelled, multi-centre, 
		parallel group randomized control trial
Study objective : Whether gated-SPECT MPI can guide the selection of which
		  patients should be treated in a staged multivessel PCI in 
		  STEMI patients that lead to reduce ischemic burden 
Arms   : Ischemia guided non-culprit PCI and Routine non-culprit PCI 
Outcome  : Compare the ischemia severity between the two arms at  one year of
	   follow-up
